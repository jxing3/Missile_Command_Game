To play the game, run ./miscom.
Extra library required : sdl, sdl_mixer
 - sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev

How to win : 
 - Survive the waves of incoming missiles.
 - Game increments to next level when last missile from last wave gets destroyed
   without all the cities being destroyed
 - The game gets more difficult every level.
 - The game is lost when all cities are destroyed.

Other things to note : 
 - Friendly fire does not exist (User-missiles do not hit the cities)
 - If the enemy missiles hit the domes, all their missiles are gone. 
 - Difficulty can be set at the start of a new game
 - Enemy missiles can "kill" their own side due to their friend's explosions. 


Possible error messages :
ALSA lib pcm.c:7339:(snd_pcm_recover) underrun occurred
 - Occurrs on VirtualBox. Thought to be Lubuntu system sound problem.
 - Was not observed on actual Ubuntu-running machine.
